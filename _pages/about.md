Hello.  I'm an aspiring data scientist who is currently a Lead Experience Manager for a large telecommunications company.  I have an extensive background in IT, specifically in web application development, Quality Assurance Testing, User Acceptance Testing, Performance Optimization, and Production Support.

I have a B.B.A in Management Informations Systems, a Master's in Computer Science, and will be completing a Master's in Data Science from Bellevue University in June 2021.  I look forward to opportunities for utilizing my data science skill sets.
